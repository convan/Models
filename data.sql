Duelz Casino is finally live and accepting new players from around the globe and in this review, we’ll cover everything Duelz casino has in its’ arsenal, including the type of gamification, tournaments and battles for the top. Duelz Casino promised to deliver something exceptional with regards to it\'s gamification and we simply cannot wait to discover what\'s in store. Currently, Duelz Casino is only available to players who access the site through a mobile device or tablet.\n\nMore Than Just An Online Casino\n\nAs touched on briefly above, Duelz casino has big plans to keep their players engaged through a process called gamification. With so many online casinos out there, operators have no choice but to get creative to differentiate themselves in such a crowded environment and gamification seems to be the next best thing. \n\nGamification essentially creates a whole new dynamic to the gaming world. It introduces elements and designs where players will need to either compete with each other in a variety of ways as well as having an elaborate scoring system to unlock achievements which will grant you access to different areas of the site, reward you with prizes as well as unlocking treasure boxes. \n\nCompetition has always been a significant part of human behaviour and at Duelz casino, players can take it to the next level. There will be competitions, leagues and tournaments that will fuel your competitive spirit and the best part is that every victory will grant you some sort of reward, be it free spins, cash prizes or otherwise. Every game you play or competition you participate in will result in earning a number of badges or points and even though we can’t confirm what you can exchange these with, we can guarantee that it will be worthwhile. \n\nCasino Games At Duelz Casino\n\nIf you’re aware of Duelz’ sister casnos Voodoo Dreams and NY Spins, you’ll quickly understand that Duelz Casino will be no different. Having an abundance of casino games to choose from is paramount to the success of any online casino, especially being new to the scene. Casino players are very quick to judge a new online casino by the number of games and the variety they have on offer, which is why we believe Duelz Casino will excel. \n\nWhether you’re a slot aficionado or a an avid table game player, Duelz casino promises not to disappoint. If Duelz casino is going to be on par with its sister casinos, slot players are in for a treat with the selection of online slots available to play. From classic slots to video slots and everything in between, Duelz casino aims is guaranteeing that players will never have a dull moment and promises to keep players entertained for hours on end. \n\nLive casino is a significant part of any online casino and we expect nothing less than a remarkable gaming experience by Duelz casino. Operators recognise the need to cater for a diverse set of players as spinning the reels is not for everyone. Working with the best game providers will not only ensure that players will have the best gaming experience but it will also reflect the players perception of the online casino. Almost all live casinos will stock the classic table games such as roulette, blackjack and baccarat, with Duelz Casino being no exception and also include a couple of game variants with slight twists on the betting structure while also catering for players with different budgets. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nA Welcome Bonus of Champs\n\nOne way for online casinos to get their name on the map is by offering a healthy and generous welcome bonus inviting players to play with more than they bargained for. Duelz sister casinos, Voodoo Dreams and NYspins both have lucrative welcome packages. A treasure chest awaits and upon registration, you\'ll be given the keys to unlock the mystery chest and since both sister casinos have a €1000 welcome package which also includes 200 welcome spins on Starburst, it’s safe to say that the treasure chest will be on par. \n\nCustomer Support Ready To Assist\n\nWhen an experienced company is about to launch a new brand, it will have all the tools and manpower in place to maintain consistency and the highest quality throughout all departments. As it\'s sister casinos Duelz casino has a dedicated team that works around the clock to resolve any issues players might be having about a range of topics. The most common way of getting in touch with the support staff is through the live chat service, where players get to speak to an agent in real-time, as opposed to an email. However, email communication is usually always an option to use too. \n\nConclusion\n\nNow that Duelz Casino has opened it\'s virtual doors to their players who sign-up through mobile, we\'ll discover whether all the hype lives up to the expectation.  The gamification enhances the gaming experience and offers much more than a regular online casino does. Compete against players, move up the ladder and unbox treasures as you play your favourite games from the best game providers in the industry. As explained in this review, we’re expecting similar welcome packages and quality of support as its sister casinos and with all the hype that’s going around, we\'re expecting Duelz Casino to be the next best thing in the online casino sphere. \n ', 'Betsoft Gaming,&nbsp;Evolution Gaming,&nbsp;Microgaming,&nbsp;Net Entertainment,&nbsp;NextGen Gaming,&nbsp;NYX Gaming,&nbsp;Play’n GO,&nbsp;Quickspin,&nbsp;RabCat,&nbsp;Thunderkick,&nbsp;Yggdrasil Gaming&nbsp;', 'English, Finish, German, Norwegian, Swedish', 'Bank Transfer,&nbsp;Credit Card,&nbsp;EcoPayz,&nbsp;PaysafeCard,&nbsp;SOFORT,&nbsp;Neteller,&nbsp;Skrill,&nbsp;Trustly,&nbsp;Zimpler,&nbsp;Pay n Play&nbsp;', '[\"Claim Your Free Treasure Chest Upon Registration!\",\"Bonus code: <\\/strong><strong class=\\\"red-text\\\">Not Required\",\"Newly registered players will receive a Treasure Chest upon creating a new account.

One thing’s for certain. Casino Calzone players will never experience a dull moment, with the abundance of games. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nOnline Slots\n\nOnline slots make up the majority of games at Casino Calzone, as is the case at almost all online casinos.

Mega Moolah, for instance, has demonstrated numerous times that the multi-million jackpot prize can be won from a few spins, but by no means is this an easy feat. \n\nJackpot slots, or progressive slots, take a miniscule percentage from every spin, which contributes towards the jackpot prize. Regardless at which online casino the jackpot slot is being played at, all players will be competing for the same prize. Some of the biggest jackpot slots available to play at Casino Calzone include Hall of Gods, Mega Fortune, Mega Moolah and Joker Millions. \n\n \n\nTable Games & Live Casino\n\nOnline casino operators know that online slots alone aren’t enough to satisfy all their players’ needs. Table games are essential in order to retain players and they serve as a break from spinning the reels for hours on end. Whether it’s roulette, blackjack, baccarat or one of the many others readily available, players are guaranteed to find a table game that suits their needs. \n\n \n\nLive Casino\n\nLive casino revolutionized the world of online casino since its inception. Players bid farewell to the days where playing their favourite casino games against a human dealer involved putting on fancy attire and heading down to the local land-based casino.  \n\nIf you’re new to online casino, this is how it works. All live casino games are streamed in crystal clear HD directly to your laptop or mobile device. All games are played against a human dealer, not a machine and the whole experience replicates the land-based casino experience players know and love.\n\nThere’s also a chat box available to converse with the dealers, adding a social element to the live casino experience. Some of the most popular live casino games available to play at Casino Calzone include Blackjack, Roulette, Monopoly, Casino Hold’em, Three Card poker and many more. \n\n \n\nCustomer Support\n\nThe customer support department is one of the main pillars of any online casino and a main contributor in keeping the ship afloat. Any negative experiences can have a detrimental effect on the company’s goodwill, which is why casino operators train their support staff vehemently in order to avoid this. \n\nThe easiest way to get in touch with a support member is through their live chat function, which aims to resolve issues in real time. Players also have the option to send an email on  support@casinocalzone.com with any issues or uncertainties they might be having, but for quick wins, head over to their frequently asked questions section, where you’ll find a issues relating to a number of topics. \n\n \n\nPayment Methods Accepted by Casino Calzone\n\nEffective and efficient payment processing to any online casino and working with the best payment providers is the only way to handle the voluminous transactions.

The other, more traditional option would be to send the team an email with difficulties, queries or issues you might be having, but the dedicated frequently asked questions section is designed to tackle the most common issues players might encounter. \n\n \n\nPayment Methods Accepted at Slotjerry Casino\n\nThe most vulnerable time for both casino operators and players is the time when deposits and withdrawals are taking place.

We strive to recommend the best online casinos and Casino.com meets all requirements for a reputable, trusted, safe and secure online casino.\n\n \n\nHundreds of Casino Games to Choose From\n\nCasino.com is one of the most recognised brands in the online casino sphere and one way to achieve such a status is by offering a multitude of games that satisfy every players’ needs. Most casino players prefer quality over quantity but we can safely say that players can enjoy the best of both worlds at Casino.com\n\nOnline casino operators are well aware of the fact that players’ needs are very diverse and to retain players, it’s paramount to have a huge selection of games ranging across all the casino products.

Some of the player favourites include Starburst, Gonzo’s Quest and Dead or Alive. \n\n \n\nJackpot Slots\n\nJackpot slots are a different animal altogether, even though they fall under the umbrella of online slots. If the stars align in your favour and lady luck is one your side, you could walk away with millions from just a couple of spins. By no means are we saying that this is an easy feat, but it’s happened many times in the past and there’s no reason to believe that it can’t happen to you. \n\nIn a nutshell, jackpot slots take a miniscule percentage from every spin, which is turn is contributed towards the jackpot prize. The jackpot prize keeps increasing as more players spin the reels of the jackpot slot, regardless at which online casino the game is played at. Once triggered, the jackpot starts again from a set amount. Some of the biggest jackpot slots available to play at Casino.com include Mega Fortune, Arabian Nights and Gladiator Road to Rome. \n\nThere are over 60 jackpot slots available at Casino.com and on the image thumbnail, the jackpot prize is clearly displayed with a live counter to make your life easier. \n\n \n\nTable Games and Live Casino\n\nThe origins of casino games stemmed from table games, with some table classics dating back hundreds of years, so it makes perfect sense to have a selection of table games in the depository.

Besides having the most popular games found at almost every online casino (blackjack and roulette), games like casino hold’em, blackjack and Caribbean Stud Poker are also available. \n\nLive Casino brings a whole new dimension to online casino as it replicated the traditional brick and mortar casino experience perfectly. This is done by streaming all games in real time, in crystal clear HD quality directly to your laptop or mobile device.

The company behind it, Imperium Network Solutions, is actually known for showing a generous hand when it comes to their bonuses, but what about the casino itself? The site is actually quite simple to navigate through, with one clear purpose in mind: getting you to play. The homepage is basically made up of just a vast selection of over 500 games and not much else. \n\n \n\nIn reality, there doesn’t seem to be an apparent theme which the casino plays around with, and we’re a bit disappointed by that if we’re being completely honest. Taking a closer look at the logo, there might be an indication of an underlying ‘King of the Casinos’ feel. The lion symbol on the logo and the name ‘Casimba’ does remind us of a popular Disney movie we’ve binge watched more times than we care to admit, but all of it is speculation when considering that the theme isn’t used enough to confirm many reviews’ guesses, including our own. Having said that, they more than make up for their lack of je ne sais quoi with their amazing welcome bonus.  \n\n \n\nThe Welcome Bonus \n\nYou might want to take a seat for this one … lord knows we had to when we heard the kind of welcome bonus Casimba Casino is offering to registering members. 200% up to £5000 + 50 free spins on your first deposit, 50% up to £1000 + 50 free spins on your second, and 75% up to £500 + 25 free spins on your third. No, we didn’t type in extra zeros by mistake, you read that quite right.  \n\n \n\nThe wagering requirement is 35x the bonus and deposit put together and you have 30 days to make use of the bonus after registration and to meet the wagering requirements for it. For all of you Skrill and Neteller users out there, we have some bad news. Casimba Casino does not consider deposits done through these payment methods as eligible for the Welcome Bonus, so you might want to use another method if you aim to make use of it. Another important thing you should know is that the maximum amount of money you can bet per slot in order to make use of the welcome bonus is £5. \n\n \n\nGame Selection \n\nWith over 500+ games, mainly slots, 37 jackpots, progressive jackpots and a number of table games, the casino is a slot lover’s dream come true. Casimba Casino has over 20 game providers with award winning licensed software, including NetEnt, Leander, Blueprint, Aristocrat, Evolution, NYX and Quickspin … the list goes on. You can expect all the casino favourites and then some to make an appearance here: Mega Moolah, Jack and the Beanstalk and Gonzo’s Quest to mention just a few. \n\n \n\nMobile Friendly\n\nCasimba Casino promises its players an amazing gaming experience across any and all platforms they might be logging into from. A promise that they’re keeping by providing over 300 games for their mobile users with unparalleled quality. \n\n \n\nLive Games\n\nWhen Evolution Gaming is involved, you can rest assured that gaming enthusiasts are in for a treat with the casino’s live selection; this is the case with Casimba Casino. Have a chat with the live dealers as you play some table game favourites like Blackjack, Roulette, and other table games, as well as Dream Catcher.\n\n \n\nCustomer Support\n\nConsidering that Casimba Casino has just launched, we’re quite impressed to see that they offer 24/7 customer support. Need something resolved? First you can take a look at their FAQ page. If you still haven’t found the solution to your problem, then you have two options: live-chat or email, and you’re promised an instant reply in both cases. \n\n \n\nSecurity and Payment \n\nWhen a casino is licenced by the UK Gambling Commission and the Government of Curacao, you know that the level of security is really high. As an added layer of security, Casimba Casino uses tried and tested payment methods like Skrill, Trustly, Neteller, Visa, Mastercard, Maestro, SEPA Bank Transfer and Paysafe Card. You can make your payments in GBP, NOK, SEK and EUR. You can expect payment to be transferred to your account within 24 hours of making the withdrawal. \n\n \n\nLoyalty Scheme\n\nWe have to give Casimba Casino this, they really know how to make someone feel like royalty. Upon placing your first deposit, you are given 500 free loyalty points which you further collect as you play, always moving one step closer towards VIP status, where you will be able to earn higher bonuses and even more free spins. You can start redeeming your loyalty points after earning 100 yourself, and you can redeem them for bonus credits to use on your favourite slots!\n\n \n\nFinal Remarks \n\nDespite not having an exciting theme which the Casino plays on, Casimba really delivers, especially when it comes to its bonus offerings. The loyalty programme is something we love about this online casino. The fact that you earn loyalty points by depositing and playing, which you can then redeem into credit for your favourite games is a nice feature that sets it apart from the rest. Being a loyal customer has probably never paid off so much. \n\n ', 'Thunderkick,&nbsp;Amaya, Big Time Gaming, 2by2 Gaming, Blueprint, Elk, Evoltion, Ezugi, Foxium, Multicommerce, NYX, Games Warehouse, Genesis Gaming, Leander, Lightning Box, Mercur Gaming, Multicommerce Game Studio, Quickspin, Rabcat, Stake Logic', 'English, Deutsch, Norsk, Svenska', 'Skrill, Trustly, Neteller, Visa, Mastercard, Maestro, SEPA Bank Transfer and Paysafe Card', '[\"Up to \\u00a36500 + 125 free spins \",\"Bonus code: <\\/strong><strong class=\\\"red-text\\\">not required\",\"200% up to \\u00a35000 + 50 free spins on your first deposit, 50% up to \\u00a31000 + 50 free spins on your second, and 75% up to \\u00a3500 + 25 free spins on your third.

Jackpot slots can either be fixed jackpots, where the jackpot prize remains unchanged, regardless how frequent it’s triggered. Progressive jackpots, on the other hand, have their jackpot prize increasing as more players spin the reels. Each spin takes a very small percentage which contributes towards the jackpot prize. \n\nSome of the biggest progressive slots available to play at Dream Jackpot casino include Mega Moolah, also known as the Millionaire Maker, Mega Fortune, Major Millions and Irish Riches Megaways, amongst others. Each jackpot slot has the jackpot prize clearly displayed on the image thumbnail to direct you towards the game with the biggest jackpot.

All live casino games are streamed directly to your laptop or mobile device in full HD and in real time.

Mega Moolah, for instance, has a maximum coin of 6.25, which is pretty reasonable considering the jackpot prize is always in the millions. \n\n \n\nTable Games and Live Casino\n\nThe roots of land-based casino stem from table games and it comes as no surprise that there still is great demand for them by casino players. Players are literally spoilt for choice, having 78 table games available at their disposal, spanning from all the classics, such as Roulette, Blackjack, Baccarat to Punto Banco, Casino Hold’em and Caribbean Stud Poker. \n\nIf you’re a table games fan and never experienced the thrill of live casino, you’re definitely in for a treat.

The other alternative is to send an email on support@21casino.com. \n\n \n\nPayment Methods Accepted\n\nPayment processing is a very vulnerable time for both players and casino operators because of the fact that any friction experienced will see players head over to competitors, never looking back.

The payment methods accepted by 21 Casino include:\n\n \n\n\n	Credit & Debit Cards\n	Trustly\n	Sofort\n	Paysafecard\n	Paypal\n	Skrill\n	Neteller\n	Bank Wire\n	Interac\n\n\n \n\nOverall Impression Of 21 Casino\n\n21 Casino is strong in all fronts, whether it’s game diversity, the generous welcome bonus or the 24 hour support, you can rest assured that the level of professionalism is second to none.

The welcome package will be split in the following way:\n\n\n	1st Deposit: 100% match bonus up to €100\n	2nd Deposit: 75% match bonus up to €150\n	3rd Deposit: 50% match bonus up to €250\n	4th Deposit: 25% match bonus up to €500\n\n\nThe welcome package will be triggered with a minimum deposit of €20 and each bonus has a wagering requirement of 45 before the funds can be withdrawn. There are some games which are not eligible to play with the bonus money, which is why we can\'t stress enough about how important it is to read over the terms and conditions before accepting any promotion. \n\nFortunately, existing players will benefit from a selection of promotions too. The promotions section at Nightrush casino is full of bonuses aimed at existing players, some of which include reload bonuses, cashbacks, daily gifts and seasonal offers, so be sure to mark this page as a favourite to stay abreast of all their latest promotions. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nGames, Games and More Games\n\nIf we’re being honest, there’s no other reason why casino players join an online casino other than to play casino games, which means the selection needs to be a healthy one to keep players entertained for hours on end. Working with the best game providers in the industry ensure the gaming experience is second to none and even though Nightrush casino is fairly new to the scene, it constantly strives to keep adding new games as they are released, to keep fire going. Just like any other online casino, the majority of Nightrush casinos’ games are slots, due to the fact that game providers release hundreds of games each year. All game types are segregated neatly into lobbies to aid players navigate effectively through the site and the game filters on the right side of the screen are in tandem. If you’re familiar with games of particular game providers, you have the option to filter games out using this option or use the search bar if you’re looking for a particular game. Some of the most popular slots available to play at Nightrush casino include Eastern Emeralds, Holmes and the Stolen Stones, Vikings go Bezerk and newly released Vikings Video Slot, to name a few. \n\nJackpot slots are also a huge part of any online casino, as these games present the opportunity to players who are looking to make more than a pretty penny. Jackpot slots, or progressive slots, take a miniscule percentage of every spin which is then put into a collective pot. Regardless at which online casino the progressive slot is being played, players will be competing for the same jackpot, which is why some of the jackpots are gargantuan. Mega Moolah, Arabian Nights and Hall of Gods are some of the player favourites available to play at Nightrush casino, jackpot slots which are always highly sought after because of their regular seven digit prize pool. \n\nTable Games\n\nTable games were the first to make their way to online casinos and essential to keep every player happy. Blackjack and roulette have their own dedicated lobbies due to all the variations there are available but if you’re looking for something different, head over to the table games section to discover all the games available. Baccarat, Casino Hold’em and Baccarat are some of the options available, where some of them are played against a real, live dealer. \n\nLive Casino\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar with live casino and a fan of table games, you’re going to be delighted to discover that live casino games are streamed directly to your desktop computer or mobile device in superior HD quality. All games are played against a human dealer in real time, just like any game you’d normally play at a land-based casino, with the only difference that you don’t need to step a foot outside your house or dress in any fancy attire. \n\nCustomer Support at Nightrush Casino\n\nOne area which cannot afford to be sub-par to the competition is customer support. Any unsatisfactory experience will be detrimental to an online casinos’ reputation, which is why Nightrush casino handles every query with utmost seriousness. The most efficient way of getting in touch with an agent is through the live chat function, where any issues players will be having will be resolved at that instant. Players also have the option to reach the team through email, but for more trivial matters, there is a handy frequently asked questions section which covers topics many players have in common, such as bonus issues, depositing queries and even technical problems with the site, to name a few. \n\nDeposit and Withdrawal Methods\n\nWe can’t think of a more frustrating situation other than problems with payment processing and players will not hesitate to opt out when transaction are anything less than seamless. This is the sole reason why Nightrush casino works with the best payment providers in the industry to ensure no friction is caused in the most vulnerable time. The following is a list with all the payment methods accepted by Nightrush casino:\n\n\n	Visa\n	Mastercard\n	Trustly\n	Paysafecard\n	Skrill\n	Neteller\n\n\nFinal Verdict \n\nNightrush casino has all the elements in place to make it a powerhouse in the gaming industry and if it maintains consistency in the long-term, it can be an example to newly formed online casinos. The game selection is vast and the welcome package speaks for itself with regards to generosity, while at the same time, giving players peace of mind that customer support agents work around the clock to assist in any way they can.

We see them pop up left and right, and to be honest; not many of them live up to the expectations. Only a handful like Duelz Casino, Genesis Casino and Spela Casino have been recently launched online casinos that have lived up to the hype and have managed to make their mark in the online casino industry. Incidentally, the latter two are owned by the same company as the casino we are going to talk about today: Casino Joy. This prestigious new brand that opened it\'s virtual doors to casino players. \n\nGenesis Global has been known for carefully expanding their impressive portfolio of online casinos with dazzling products that add value to the player. Think of great brands such as Spinit, Casino Cruise, Sloty Casino and Vegas Hero as well as the above mentioned casinos. All of these brands have been created with the player’s wants and needs in mind, providing a casino experience that is unmatched to your standard run-of-the-mill casino. Now with their newest creation; Casino Joy, Genesis Global is here to provide a unique product to the gambling public. It is safe to say that Casino Joy is sure to be a joy to play at. What this new casino is going to bring to the table is something we will discuss in this review. \n\n\n\nCasino Bonuses at Casino Joy\n\nWhen looking at its sister casinos, we can conclude that all of them bring amazing welcome offers and weekly bonuses to the player. With Genesis Casino offering a whopping €/$1000 welcome package plus 200 Free Spins, it is no secret that Genesis Global knows how to satisfy their players. When speculating about the welcome package available at Casino Joy, we can only assume that it will look similar to that of Casino Joy’s sister casino, perhaps even better.\n\nAnother element in terms of casino bonuses that Genesis Global offers to their players  are weekly bonuses and reload bonuses. These bonuses are meant to keep existing customers happy and allow them to easily top-up their bankroll with extra bonus funds and free spins. \n\nMulti-Tier Welcome Package at Casino Joy\n\nA recurring theme within Genesis Global casinos is a multi-tier welcome package. Players who sign-up to Casino Joy will benefit from a generous welcome package worth €1000 split over the first four deposits and 200 bonus spins granted on the first. To be precise, a total welcome package at Casino Joy measuring up to €1000 looks like this:\n\n \n\n\n	\n		\n			Deposit\n			Match\n			Max Bonus\n			Bonus Code\n		\n		\n			1st \n			100%\n			 €200 + 200 Bonus Spins\n			None\n		\n		\n			2nd\n			50%\n			 €200\n			WJOY2\n		\n		\n			3rd\n			25%\n			 €300\n			WJOY3\n		\n		\n			4th\n			25%\n			 €300\n			WJOY4\n		\n	\n\n\n \n\nWith a total welcome package of up to $/€1000, the player will have the option to claim this offer over four separate deposits. The first deposit bonus will look somewhat like: 100% up to $/€100 plus an amount of Free Spins. Meaning that the casino will match any deposit made with the same amount in bonus funds, giving the player double their money to play with. The remaining three deposit bonuses might look similar, either containing a higher match up percentage or a lower one capped at a higher amount, for example: 50% up to $/€300.\n\nAvailable Games at Casino Joy\n\nOne thing that casinos that fall under Genesis Global pride themselves in, is the the extensive range of casino games they have on offer. Casino Joy will only offer the best of the best in terms of casino games to their players. This means that that software providers who want to offer their games at this casino need to have a proven track record of creating visually stunning slot machines.

Here we can see big names like Yggdrasil Gaming, Microgaming, Netent, NYX Gaming, Play ‘n Go and Quickspin. All of these game studios are known for continuously publishing top-shelf games with unique and exciting features. \n\nWhen it comes down to the live dealer section of Casino Joy, we can expect this to be filled with professionally hosted live games from NetEnt and Evolution Gaming. These two software providers are known for having the best in-house live dealers who will guide you through your favourite blackjack, roulette or baccarat games. \n\nAnother trait that Genesis Global casinos are known for are their skyrocketing progressive jackpots.

There are a wide array of bonuses to profit from, ranging from extra Free Spins to tournaments that make your heart beat faster. Let’s take a look at the welcome package for new players first.\n\nWelcome Bonus Package at GemSlots Casino\n\n\nDecent casinos will offer a new player a single, one-time match up bonus when they place their first deposit. But GemSlots Casino is not your average, run-of-the-mill online casino. This casino offers players not one, not two but three separate deposit bonuses all of a very generous nature. In total, players will be able to receive up to £500 in bonus funds through a so-called “match up bonus”. This means that players can place a deposit and the casino will match the amount up to a certain percentage on bonus cash. This bonus money can then be wagered on your favourite slot machine. \n\nYour first deposit: When placing your first deposit, new players will be able to enjoy a match up bonus of 100% up to £250. This means that if you decide to place a first-time deposit of £50, GemSlots Casino will give you an extra £50 to play with. To sweeten the deal even further, they will also throw in an extra 50 Free Spins which can be used on your favourite slot games. (Canadian players cannot redeem their Free Spins on any NetEnt games, but there are plenty of other top-notch providers to choose from at GemSlots Casino.)\n\nYour second deposit: Hungry for more? Then you are in luck, buddy. Because when you have had you fill with the first deposit offer, you will be given the chance to make use of the second deposit offer. This second deposit offer consists of 50% up to £100. Meaning that if you were to deposit £50, you will get an extra £25 in bonus cash. \n\nYour third deposit: This is the third and final deposit offer that players can make use of, kind of like a desert after the main meal. For players who are looking to gain that final boost in bonus cash, this is their chance. Place your third deposit and you will receive a bonus of 100% up to £100.\n\nSlot Machines Galore and Live Dealer Games at GemSlots\n\n\nGemSlots wouldn’t honour its own name if it did not offer a goldmine in terms of online casino games.

Most new online casinos work around the players’ needs and design the site in such a way to ensure navigation is seamless. Casino games are usually split into game lobbies, grouping games into sections rather than having a cluster of games all under one section. \n\nHaving a search function goes a long way to help players find their favourite casino games, as opposed to searching for games manually. \n\nExpect a Huge Selection of Games\n\nWorking with the best game providers gives casino players assurance that they’re in good hands. Most of Untold Casinos’ games are produced by NetEnt, Betsoft, Play\'n GO, Pragmatic Play and Evolution Gaming, which is evident that you’ll be privy to some of the best casino games known to mankind. \n\nWhen it comes down to casino games, quality entertainment supersedes anything else and a wide selection of games is essential to satisfy the needs of all types of players, be it recreational or the more experienced casino players. Jackpot slots are preeminent as players of all backgrounds will be looking to try their luck on the money makers, in the hope of getting their hands on seven digit figures. \n\nLive casino plays an important role in serving players’ needs. Online casinos understands that different players have different needs and it’s pertinent to have live casino games available in their arsenal if they’re looking to delight players. Live casino has revolutionized the online casino industry because of the fact that it replicated the land-based casino perfectly. Gone are the days where players put on their fancy tuxedo and head out for a night on the town to play their favourite games. These days, players can find their most comfortable armchair and with a secure internet connection, they’ll be able to have all the classic table games streamed in stunning HD directly to their desktop. Keep in mind that live casino can be played on any mobile device and for uninterrupted play, you’ll need to have a solid internet connection. \n\n\n\nPromotions and Welcome Bonuses\n\nAlmost all online casinos offer their new players a welcome bonus as a token of appreciation for joining them. Untold Casino will need to create a lucrative welcome bonus to stand out of the crowd and get noticed. Most online casino will offer a 100% deposit bonus, which simply means that when you make your first deposit, Untold casino will match it up to a certain amount. For instance, if it’s a 100% deposit bonus up to €150, the maximum amount eligible for the bonus will be €150. Anything over the stipulated amount will not contribute towards the bonus. \n\nCustomer Support At Untold Casino\n\nWhen it comes down to customer support, casinos know not to cut corners. Players will need to feel secure that if they encounter any issues, they’ll have a dedicated team at their disposal. The most convenient way of communicating with the team is via the live chat service, and while we’re not certain that this service will be available, we’re assuming that it will be. However, since Untold Casino is a brand new casino, we don’t expect the live chat service to be available around the clock, but you’ll also have the option to contact the team via emails when the live chat service is unavailable. \n\nTo ensure players don’t waste time contacting the customer support department, many online casinos will create a set of frequently asked questions that many players encounter on a range of topics. This way, players can spend less time finding solutions to their problems and more time doing what they love most - playing online casino games. \n\nConclusion\n\nFrom the information we’ve managed to gather here at CasinoTopsOnline.com, we believe that Untold Casino will be unveiling huge plans for it’s official launch. Casino enthusiasts from around the globe will be watching closely as Untold casino gets closer to it’s official launch day. There will be no margin for error, as casino players are hard critics and have high expectations due to all the already well established brands and the standard they set. \n ', 'Betsoft Gaming,&nbsp;Evolution Gaming,&nbsp;Net Entertainment,&nbsp;Play’n GO,&nbsp;Pragmatic Play&nbsp;', '', 'Credit Card&nbsp;', '[\"\\u20ac\\/$9999 Welcome Package + \\u20ac\\/$999 cashback VIP Bonus\",\"Bonus code: <\\/strong><strong class=\\\"red-text\\\">Not Required\",\"\\u20ac750 Deposit Bonus Welcome Package\",\"Bonus code: <\\/strong><strong class=\\\"red-text\\\">Not Required\"]', '2018', NULL, NULL, 0, '2019-07-09 20:02:27', '2019-07-09 20:02:27'),

In this review we are going to take a closer look at Yeti Casino.\n\nThe Hospitable Snowman\n\nYeti casino might be named after a famed and vicious creature of legends, but this yeti is different.

Perhaps you are familiar with several of the myths and superstitious beliefs that people think about or practice when they want their wish to be granted. \n\nPeople have been known to wish upon shooting stars, throw coins into wishing wells, blowing out the candles on our birthday cakes, breaking wishbones, making a wish when the clock strikes 11:11; the list goes on and on. Whether we have our wishes granted or it falls down to pure coincidence is up to debate but there is one place where wishes do come true: Wishmaker Casino. \n\nWishmaker Casino: Where Wishes Come True\n\nIt is the dream of every gambler: to win the life-changing jackpot of your dreams. Many wish for it, yet few are able to make it come true. With a name like Wishmaker Casino we cannot completely guarantee for wishes to come true, but it certainly is a place where one can try their luck.\n\nFalling under Gaming Innovation Group, the same creators of great brands such as Highroller Casino, Kaboo, Rizk and Guts, Wishmaker Casino is the newest addition to the casino family. Earlier last year the iGaming company launched the extremely successful online casino Highroller, completely changing the world of online gambling and taking it up to new heights.  Wishmaker Casino features all the good stuff we have seen from its sister casino and more; boasting exciting gamification features and more than a thousand games to choose from.\n\nCasino Bonuses at Wishmaker Casino\n\nA welcome or deposit bonus is usually the main factor that pulls new players into signing up with a casino. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that online casinos offer competitive and rewarding welcome bonuses to their players. That being said, here at Casino Tops Online we cannot really complain about the welcome bonuses we have so far seen from the GIG Brands, they all come with a generous bonus for newly registered players. Aside from that, the casinos made by this company all come with their own intricate reward systems like the BUX at SuperLenny. \n\n\n\nWelcome Bonus (EU)\n\nIn the case of Wishmaker Casino, there is stunning two-tier welcome package available for newly registered players based in the European Union. This makes sure that new players are made to feel welcome right off the bat. There is a total welcome offer available of €200 + 50 Free Spins. In order to claim this bonus, you will have to follow the following steps:\n\n\n	Place your first deposit of a minimum of €10 and receive a 100% match bonus up to €50.\n	You will also receive 50 Free Spins for the Reactoonz slot. (10 Free Spins every day)\n	Place your second deposit and receive a bonus of 100% up to €150.\n\n\n \n\nWelcome Bonus (UK)\n\n\n	For players based in the United Kingdom, there is a welcome offer available of up to 500 Wish Spins on Starburst by Netent.\n	Place your first deposit of a minimum of £10 and receive a 100 Instant Wish Spins. \n	Place a deposit of £50 and above and you will receive 200 instant Wish Spins, plus 300 Wish Spins on Starburst split over 3 days.\n\n\n\nWelcome Bonus (Canada)\n\nCanadian players will benefit from a welcome bonus as well, which consists of a total of $250 + 100 Free Spins.\n\n\n	Place your first deposit of a minimum of $10 and receive a 100% match bonus up to $100.\n	You will also receive 100 Free Spins for the Reactoonz slot. (20 Free Spins every day)\n	Place your second deposit and receive a bonus of 100% up to $150.\n\n\n\nWelcome Bonus (New Zealand)\n\nPlayers based in New Zealand aren’t left out either, and will profit from a welcome bonus of $250 + 100 Free Spins.\n\n\n	Place your first deposit of a minimum of $10 and receive a 100% match bonus up to $100.\n	You will also receive 100 Free Spins for the Reactoonz slot. (20 Free Spins every day)\n	Place your second deposit and receive a bonus of 100% up to $150.\n\n\nPlease note that all deposit bonuses come with a wagering requirement of 35x.\n\nGamification Features at Wishmaker Casino\n\nAnother trend we can see in online casinos coming from this brand are the gamification features. Gamification means that the casino implements a \"video game\" aspect into their product, giving players a goal to work toward and enhancing the gameplay experience for the user. Casinos like HighRoller, Rizk and Guts all contribute to implementing the gamification aspect so gamblers can elevate their gaming experience. They do this by either implementing a process bar that can be filled by gaining experience or even by having the player follow a storyline by completing quests. \n\nSince GiG is a master at creating casinos with cool gamification features; Wishmaker Casino cannot be left out. In this casino players will be able to gain levels, collect trophies and claim extra rewards with each level gained.

We’re giving you all the details, but don’t forget to check out their terms and conditions before signing up. \n\n \n\nSigning Up\n\nAs a little taster of what’s in store, NYSpins gives you 20 free spins upfront, as soon as you sign up. No deposit needed and you can use them instantly on a choice of three games: Starburst, Joker Pro and Wild Wild West.\n\n \n\nOn your 1st Deposit\n\nWhen placing your first deposit, you’ll receive 20 free spins every day for 9 days, giving you a total of 180 free spins.

If adventure is what you’re searching for, look no further, as slots like Sticky Bandits, Vikings Go Wild and Book of the Dead have got you covered.

Tend to stick to games that are more traditional? No problem there, as a number of table games are available with the option of playing live too! \n\n \n\nThis is but a taste of what NYSpins Casino offers its players in terms of gameplay, and we’d expect no less when the games are a product of top notch providers such as NetEnt, Microgaming, Yggdrasil, Thunderkick, NextGen, NYX, Play’n GO, Quickspin, Betsoft and PNG. While the Casino might focus more on slots, there’s something for every kind of player, but you won’t be able to access all levels and games upon registration; with NYSpins Casino, you have to earn them. \n\n \n\nAs you play, you’ll earn points which you can then spend on unlocking new neighbourhoods and features, allowing you to earn even bigger and better points and bonuses. The first city you’ll unlock is Manhattan, and after you conquer that, you’ll move on to other exciting places such as the Empire State Building, Madison Square Garden, all the way to your last pit stop, the Statue of Liberty. Obviously, the higher the level, the more difficult the task, but that also means that the rewards for passing through to each level increase too! Rewards vary between cash bonuses and free spins; some levels require deposits and some don’t, either way, it’s definitely a different and fun way of making some cash. \n\n \n\nIs the Casino Mobile Friendly?\n\nOne of the first things you’ll read when you visit the site is that the games found on NYSpins casino are displayed in full HD no matter what device you are using, giving you an unparalleled game experience whether you are on your tablet, phone or desktop. \n\n \n\n \n\nIs Live Casino Available?\n\nNot only can you play Live with NYSpins, but you could also do it with the same quality on your phone and tablet, meaning that you can even play live on the go; all you need is a good internet connection. Live Dealers are also fluent in a number of languages such as English, Dutch and German amongst others, making you feel even more at home. \n\n \n\nIf we’re being honest, the table and live game section is not every game fanatic’s dream come true. Some table game favourites such as Baccarat are missing, but we haven’t lost hope yet; the casino is quite new and games are constantly being added so keep your fingers crossed. \n\n \n\nPayment Methods\n\nPlayers are not only spoilt for choice when it comes to game selection, but also in  selecting payment methods. Entercash, Euteller, iDeal, Mastercard, Neteller, Skrill, Trustly, Visa and Zimpler are available to put in deposits. Deposit minimum is of €/£/kr 10 and typically instant in all cases. Withdrawals are also instant, except for MasterCard and Visa which may take up to 2-4 days to process.    \n\n \n\nCustomer Support\n\nCompared to other Casinos in its playing field, NYSpins Casino lacks the extensive customer care options that some might like from its competitors; however, customer support is very easily reachable via their online chat. \n\n \n\nSecurity \n\nNYSpins Casino is licensed by the Malta Gaming Authority, meaning that you can sleep soundly at night knowing your money is 100% safe.

Anything you need, you’ll find on the homepage: the best games to play, multiple bonuses and all other useful info like game providers, payment methods and whatever else you might need to know.  The Website is also available in four languages: English, Suomi, Norsk and Svenska. \n\n \n\nSomething else we really love about this casino? The “twin” word play. With ‘Mission Twinpossible’ and some great ‘Twintroduction Offers’, navigating through the site alone is just really fun, but not as fun as benefiting from their amazing welcome bonus! \n\n \n\nThe Welcome Bonus\n\nYour first deposit bonus finds its identical twin in Twin Casino, as the 100% up to €100 offered on your first payment is replicated on your second deposit. For your first and second deposit, you’ll be earning a total of 100% up to €200. See what we mean when we say we’re really digging this whole “twin” theme? And that’s not all folks! Deposit €50 or more and you get 50 free spins on both your first and second deposit, which you can spend on an Yggdrasil favourite ‘Sunny Shores’. \n\n \n\nYou have 30 days to make use of these bonuses upon sign up. The wagering requirement for the welcome bonus is 35x the deposit amount and you have 30 days to complete it. \n\n \n\nApart from the welcome bonus, Twin Casino regularly updates its site with ongoing bonuses and tournaments, which you can take a better look at here. \n\n \n\nGames\n\nThe software used by Twin Casino comes from NetEnt, Microgaming, Quickspin, Yggdrasil and Evolution Gaming, so you might already have a good hunch on the type of games to look out for on this online casino. This online gaming site currently has over 300 games, and since it’s still relatively new, you can bet on that number doubling in the near future. \n\n \n\nNew games like ‘Jungle Books’, ‘Shangri-la’ and ‘Fairygate’ all make an appearance together with all-time favourites such as ‘Gonzo’s Quest’, ‘Robin Hood’, ‘Fruit Zen’, ‘Thunderstuck’ and ‘Arabian Nights’. The casino also offers players the option to play progressive games, and that’s just when it comes to slots… \n\n \n\nTwin Casino’s table game selection is surprisingly extensive. Like to play roulette? One type simply won’t do. Choose between European, French and American Roulette amongst a wide choice of other games like Red Dog, Black Jack and Poker. That’s basically all your table favourites under one roof.    \n\n \n\nLive Games\n\nTwin Casino’s live game selection is impressive to say the least. Not only do they have basically all table games in live version, but in most instances you can choose between more than one of the same option. Different languages are also offered for games like roulette.  \n\n \n\nBest of all? This casino offers Dream Catcher as one of its live options, which is not something commonly found in other live casinos.\n\n \n\nMobile Users\n\nAny mobile gaming lovers out there? Good news lies ahead for you in the next few lines. Twin Casino has a high quality mobile version of their website, which means that when it comes to playing your favourite games, you can do it on the go with the greatest of ease.  \n\n \n\nCustomer Support\n\nThe casino hasn’t been operating for long, so expecting a 24/7 customer care service would probably be setting the expectations a bit too high. If you come across any problems on Twin Casino and you need to contact someone, you have two options: send an e-mail or use their live chat option. Their live chat opening hours depend on what language you’re using the site in. Having said that, the website promises a response within 24 hours regardless of what method you decide to contact them with. \n\n \n\nCan’t be bothered to wait for their reply? You can always visit their FAQ page to see if you can find your answer there. At the moment, their ‘Get in Touch’ page indicates that their typical response time is 30 seconds, but we’re guessing this varies according to time zones and which location you’re in. \n\n \n\nPayment Options\n\nWhen it comes to making your payment, you can rest assured that your money is safe with this casino. This online gaming site makes use of SSL (Secure Socket Layer) Encryption, setting up very high security standards for the way your transactions are made. \n\n \n\nWhen making a deposit, you can make use of Visa, Credit and Debit cards, Neteller, Skrill, Zimpler, Bankwire, Paysafe Card and Trustly. You have less options if you’re withdrawing; Bank wire, Trustly, Skrill, Neteller, Credit and Debit Card. Minimum Deposit and Withdrawal for Trust Casino is 200 NOK, 200 SEK, 20 EUR, 20 GBP, 20 USD, 20 AUD and 20 CAD. The maximum amount of money that you can withdraw varies according to the type of withdrawal method you are using; except for Trustly, Bank Wire and Zimpler, the maximum withdrawal amount is capped at €1000. \n\n \n\nSecurity\n\nTwin Casino is licensed by the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) and the Government of Curacao. Apart from being secure on that front, all the information you provide, the casino encrypts, meaning that your information and details are kept 100% private. The payment methods used are also tried and tested, trustworthy sources so we think it is safe to say that when it comes to playing with this Casino, the issue of security should be of absolutely no concern. \n\n \n\nFinal Remarks\n\nTwin Casino creators took a risk that most definitely paid off. We’re excited to see whether or not they will be sticking to this twin theme when it comes to future bonuses; let’s face it, we all have our fingers crossed for this one. The casino’s strength definitely lies in their selection of live games; having said that, we’re eager to see how they will be expanding their game repertoire; other than that, this Casino gets a huge thumbs up from us! \n\n ', 'Yggdrasil Gaming,&nbsp;Quickspin, Yggdrasil, Evolution Gaming', 'English, Suomi, Norsk and Svenska', 'Visa, Credit and Debit cards, Neteller, Skrill, Zimpler, Bankwire, Paysafe card and Trustly', '[\"100% Up to \\u20ac200 + 100 spins\",\"Bonus code: <\\/strong><strong class=\\\"red-text\\\">not required\",\"Get 100% up to  \\u20ac100 on your first deposit and 100% up to  \\u20ac100 when you make your second.

Having limited options will not only deter players from signing up, but will also be extremely hard for online casinos to retain their players. It’s safe to say that at Big Thunder Slots, you’ll never run out of options, having hundreds of games to choose from and more added on a regular basis. \n\nIf you’re an avid slot player, you can use the search function situated on the right side of your screen to help you get to all your favourite games quicker. While the filtering options are not the greatest when compared to other online casinos, you can still filter games by player favourites, newest games, jackpot slots and an option to have all games listed in alphabetical order. \n\nSome of the most popular slots available to play at Big Thunder Slots include Gonzo’s Quest, Holmes and the Stolen Stones, Rainbow Riches and the ever so popular, Starburst. \n\n \n\nJackpot Slots\n\nIf you’re looking to make a pretty penny, you should consider playing Jackpot Slots, as they have the ability to turn pocket change to small fortunes. Jackpot slots can either be progressive, which essentially means that the jackpot prize keeps increasing as more players spin the reels, or fixed jackpots, where the prize is always constant irrespective of how often it’s triggered. One jackpot slot adored by many casino players is Mega Moolah, which is notoriously known for its colossal jackpot wins. The African themed slot has been making players millionaires since it was released and it’s one of 38 jackpot slots available to play at Big Thunder\n\nSlots. Some other big names include Fluffy Mega Jackpot and Irish Luck. While it’s not easy to trigger a huge jackpot win, there were many cases were a few spins changed players’ lives forever. \n\n \n\nTable Games\n\nEven though Big Thunder Slots is an all-slots casino, it still stocks a few tables games for players who want a break from spinning the reels. Roulette, Blackjack and Casino Hold’em are the only games available at Big Thunder Slots. Players who are looking to take a break from spinning the reels can find solace knowing that a few table games are available at Big Thunder Slots.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nThe Thunderous Welcome Bonus\n\nNew online casinos will need to go the extra mile to attract players to the site. With all the stiff competition in the online casino industry, operators will need to find the perfect balance between feasibility and generosity of the welcome bonus offered to their players. Big Thunder slots has a slightly different approach to welcome bonuses. Players who sign up to the online casino will get to spin the Mega Reels and the welcome bonus will be chosen at random, as opposed to a set package. Players will be in the chance of claiming one of many prizes, including up to 500 Welcome Spins on Starburst, Amazon Vouchers, to name a few.\n\nYou might want to keep the promotions page handy, as Big Thunder Slots has a total of eight promotions available, which include cashbacks, free spins, happy hours and a great loyalty program that rewards players with freebies for playing games. All promotions come with a set of terms and conditions that must be adhered to, so be sure to read over them carefully to ensure you qualify for the promotion.\n\nSupport When You Need It Most\n\nThe customer support department is one of the main pillars that keeps the ship afloat and it’s reassuring for players to know that they have a dedicated team to turn to when they encounter a problem. The easiest and most convenient way to get in touch with the team is through live chat, where players get instant answers to their queries about a range of topics. Contacting the team through email is another viable option but if you’re looking for quick answers, head over to the FAQ section. The FAQ section is full of common issues new players might encounter when signing up to Big Thunder Slots. \n\nDepositing Methods\n\nBig Thunder Slots prides itself in working with the best payment providers to ensure players never experience any trouble when depositing or withdrawing funds to their account. Operators will always have a couple of depositing options available and Big Thunder Slots accepts the following: Visa, Mastercard, Maestro, PayPal, paysafecard and pay by mobile. \n\nPlay The Best Games On The Go\n\nGone are the days where players had to be shackled to their desktop computers to enjoy their favourite casino games. As the use of mobile increases, casino operators had to quickly adapt to ensure players experience the same thrill when playing on mobile as they would experience when playing on their desktop computers.

This doesn’t necessarily mean that players need to deposit the maximum amount, but the maximum amount that is doubled will be €140. For example, if a player deposits €30, another €30 will be added to their bankroll as bonus money.\n\nIt’s pertinent to note that every deposit bonus comes with a set of wagering requirements that must be met in order for the bonus amount to be eligible for a withdrawal. The terms and conditions of the welcome bonus will stipulate the details and any breaches of said terms might result in confiscation of the bonus funds. \n\nThe ‘Premium’ Welcome Package is designed for the more daring players who have bigger gambling budgets. The Premium welcome bonus is gargantuan in nature and players will benefit from a €1,500 package but the main condition of this promotion is that five deposits must be done within the first week of signing up. The following is a detailed breakdown of the deposit amounts that must be made in order to qualify for the Premium Package:\n\n\n	1st Deposit, use code Welcome1 and get 100% up to €100 Bonus\n	2nd Deposit, use code Welcome2 and get 30% up to €350 Bonus\n	3th Deposit, use code Welcome3 and get 30% up to €350 Bonus\n	4th Deposit, use code Welcome4 and get 30% up to €350 Bonus\n	5th Deposit, use code Welcome5 and get 30% up to €350 Bonus\n\n\n888casino players will be delighted to discover that the promotion section is teeming and this is just one of the many benefits of playing with a well established online casino. For instance, if you’re a live casino enthusiast, 888casino has three dedicated promotions, one which includes an €8 bonus when the roulette ball lands on the number ‘8’. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nThe Welcome Bonus New Jersey\n\n‘Less is more’ certainly doesn’t apply to 888 Casino’s welcome bonus because what you’re about to find is far beyond the industry standard. As the name suggests, the welcome bonus is only available to new players but before we get into the main offer, we’ll take a closer look at the no deposit bonus that 888 casino is offering to all new players upon registration. \n\n888 casino is giving away $20 to all new players, simply for signing up, no strings attached, without the need to make a deposit. The $20 can be used on a huge selection of games, including video slots, classic slots and even jackpot slots. Once you’ve verified your email address, 888 Casino will send you $20 to kickstart your journey. \n\n\n\nNow, onto the monstrous welcome package. New players who sign-up to 888 casino will be eligible for a welcome package worth $2000! The welcome package will be split over two deposits, both of which are equally the same. \n\nThe first part of the welcome package consists of a 50% deposit bonus of up to $1000. This essentially means any deposit you make, up to a maximum of $1000, 888 casino will give you half your deposit amount in bonus money. The second deposit is identical to the first but you will need to use the promo code ‘WELCOME888’ in order to activate the welcome package.  \n\nThere really is no catch to this promotion, however, each and every promotion comes with a set of terms and conditions which must be respected in order for the promotion to remain active. These can be found below the welcome bonus section and it clearly displays information regarding wagering requirements, the minimum deposit and other relevant information that players should be aware about. \n\nGame Selection at 888casino\n\nWe can safely say, that regardless of your game preference, you’re guaranteed to find exactly what you’re looking for when playing at 888casino with the possibility of discovering something that you’ve never encountered before. 888casino work with the best game providers in the industry to deliver a superior gaming experience that supersedes anything you’ve experienced anywhere else. \n\nOnline slots come in abundance. Ranging from classic slots to jackpot slots and everything in between, 888casino has truly got it all! You’ll even be privy to exclusive slot games that are impossible to play anywhere else. This means that 888casino collaborate with game providers to have slots designed specifically for them. All the slots available at 888casino are segmented neatly into game lobbies to ensure players navigate efficiently through the site and the search function on the top left side of your screen to help you get to your favourite games quicker \n\nJackpot slots are adored by players because of the fact that a few spins could potentially end up rewarding them with a seven digit payout. Needless to say, this is not easy to achieve, as lady luck needs to be on your side and the stars need to align perfectly for this to happen. However, this has happened many times in the past, especially with Mega Moolah by Microgaming, which is nicknamed the ‘Millionaire Maker’ for a reason. Some of the biggest jackpot slots to play at 888casino include Aztec Realm, Millionaire Genie and Voyage of the Vikings. \n\n \n\nTable Games and Live Casino\n\nIt would be sinful for an operator of 888casino magnitude to not stock a good selection of table games in their arsenal of games. Besides, table games are the foundation of any land-based casino and for an online casino to compete on all fronts, tables games are an essential part. \n\nTable games are usually labelled ‘casino games’ and these are games that are played against as opposed to ones being played against a real, live dealer. Make no mistake, table games or casino games are fast paced and full of action and are usually played by gamblers who prefer  faster games. Apart from the classics, such as roulette and blackjack and all their variations, 888casino has baccarat, video poker as well as craps and keno in their depository. \n\nLive casino defers from ‘casino games’ as all live casino games are played against a human dealer, as opposed to a machine. Live casino games are streamed in crystal clear HD to players’ laptops or mobile devices and it replicates the traditional brick-and-mortar experience perfectly. Players can conversate with the dealer in the dedicated chat box, adding a social element to the game which is a great feature to bring the games to life. But be warned that no profanity or abuse hurled at the dealer will be tolerated and any unwarranted behaviour will most likely get you banned from the casino altogether. \n\n \n\nPayment Methods Accepted by 888Casino\n\nThe most vulnerable times for a casino operator is payment processing and there’s nothing more frustrating for a player than friction when making transactions, whether it’s a deposit or a withdrawal. This is the principal reason why 888casino only work with the best payment providers to ensure payment processing is seamless when handling transactions. The following is a list of payment options available at 888casino:\n\n\n	Visa\n	Mastercard\n	PayPal\n	Neteller\n	Sofort\n	Online Banking\n	Trustly\n	Ecopays\n	Skrill\n	Webmoney\n	Bank Transfer\n	Astropay\n	Instadebit\n\n\nPayment Methods Accepted by 888 New Jersey\n\nPayment processing needs to be seamless in order to avoid hiccups, which is why 888 casino only works with the best payment providers to handle their voluminous demand for transactions. \n\nThere are a couple of options available for players to fund their accounts:\n\n\n	Visa\n	Mastercard\n	Bank Transfer\n	PayPal\n	Cash at Cage - The Caesars Atlantic City Cage allows you to instantly deposit cash into your 888casino NJ account. Stop by in person to make a deposit or withdrawal\n	Prepaid Card - Visit your local 7-Eleven store in NJ, 24/7 and make a deposit with PayNearMe. When depositing at 888casino, select Cash at 7-Eleven, use the barcode and complete your deposit\n\n\nCustomer Support\n\nHaving a robust customer support department is essential to keep the ship afloat and having anything below par will detrimental to any online casinos’ success. 888casino have invested heavily in having an efficient support team and getting in touch with an agent has never been easier. The fastest and most efficient way to get in touch is through their live chat feature, where players are able to get answers to their queries in real time. \n\nThe other, more traditional ways of getting in touch with a team member are through email or telephone.

Apart from that minor setback, everything else is smooth sailing; game selection and odds are promising. \n\n \n\nThe website offers punters a vast choice of events but the main focus seems to revolve around horseracing. As already mentioned, their biggest strength obviously lies in Australian sports, but their International selection definitely won’t disappoint. For racing, Sportsbet offers the best odds on every thoroughbred races taking place in Australia; they offer a strong horse-racing line up and follow through even when it comes to greyhound racing.\n\n \n\nSoccer is covered pretty well with up to a 100 markets across a 100 leagues. The only other thing that might not be so favourable is that this sportsbook is slightly limited when it comes to e-sports, so if that’s what’s down your alley, you might want to take a left turn here. \n\n \n\nNot that into sports? Well in reality you shouldn’t really be browsing through a sportsbook, but hey! To each their own right? Either way, in that case, Sportsbet actually offers bets on non-sport related events; all you have to do is head to the “Novelties” section of the left hand side sport event selection. Here you can bet on your favourite contestant in a reality tv show or even who’s going to win what in the Oscars. \n\n \n\nWelcome Bonus\n\nSportsbookers will be happy to know that registering with Sportsbet comes with a pretty nice welcome bonus upon your first deposit. 100% up to $501; generous indeed! Once you register, you have 30 days to make use of this bonus.\n\n \n\nOnce those 30 days are up, you can profit from the other ongoing promotions, and believe use, you’ll want to cash in on the promotions. There’s a reason why it’s considered as the website that runs the best regular promotions in the country.\n\n \n\nOn a daily basis, the website nominates one particular race in which you’ll be able to get your money back, refunded in cash. \n\n \n\nThis website runs the best regular promotions in the country. There are also a number of ongoing competitions where you get to win cash prizes; and there is even a refer-a-friend scheme where you can get up to a $100 bonus. Let’s just say that we can definitely see why it’s a favourite among sportsbook users.\n\n \n\nPayment Methods\n\nPayment Method choices are ace with Sportsbet. To make a deposit, you can make use of Bank Transfer, Bpay, Credit/Debit Card, Skrill, Paypal and Poli. The choice isn’t as vast when it comes to making your withdrawal as you can only use Bank Transfer, Skrill and Paypal. The minimum amount you can deposit is $5.00 and the minimum amount you can bet is $0.01, unless you’re placing your bet by phone. We’re guessing that betting via a phone call is a bit of a hassle as the minimum amount you can bet here is $50. \n\n \n\nThe bet margin for Sportsbet is 5.6%, which we admit, is not the best around, but you only have to wager x1 times to earn your winnings. The maximum amount you can win on a daily basis is barred at $500,000. \n\n \n\nOne of the best things about Sportsbet? Their own personal Sportsbet cash card, hands down. Owning this card allows you instant access to your winnings and money at any ATM. Consider this as a way that turns your winnings into instant cash as opposed to having to wait three to five days until the transfer is complete. \n\n \n\nSecuirty\n\nThis sportsbook is licenced by Australia’s Northern Territory Government and makes use of SSL Encryption. The questions of security shouldn’t be a question to start with. Apart from being super secure from that front, it also has a DigiCert Secure Certificate, is a member of the Australian Wagering Council, and actively encourages responsible gaming. \n\n \n\nMobile Friendly \n\nIf your device of choice is mobile and you’re looking for a sportsbooker that takes that as their first consideration, then look no further! Sportsbet is your guy. The app has all the offers available and you can watch live streams through it as well. Apart from having a great design and look, it’s easy to use and very convenient to have, so what are you waiting for? Visit the app or play store and get it!  \n\n \n\nLive Options\n\nHorseracing enthusiasts will be happy to know that all horse races are available for live streaming on any device. If using mobile, you can also watch live stream through the sportsbet app. Although live stream is available, live betting is not; the only way you can place your bet while a game is ongoing is to do it via a phone call.\n\n \n\nYou can also cash-out mid match to keep your advantage in cases where the match isn’t doing as well as you hoped. In cases where you placed your bet through a phone call, the only way to cash-out mid match is through phone call as well. \n\n \n\nCustomer Support\n\nSportsbet offer a number of customer support services, but it’s not exactly the best around. Live chat is available but it is not 24/7. You can find a customer representative to chat with between 7am to midnight, Monday to Saturday or 8am to 9pm on a Sunday. You could even give them a ring if you prefer; in that case, lines are available from 8am to 11pm. Your other option is e-mail or message via their social media pages, to which you should get a pretty quick reply, unless you contact them after 11pm, in which case you’d have to wait till morning. Their FAQ page is pretty comprehensive, so before contacting a representative, maybe you should give that a go first. \n\n \n\nFinal Remarks\n\nJust like any other Sportsbook around, Sportsbet has its ups and its down but luckily, the ups leave much more of an impact. Great event selection, promising odds on more than just sports and a fantastic bonus to welcome newcomers with. Come on, give it a burl, we promise you, you won’t be disappointed. \n\n \n\n ', '', 'English', 'Bank Transfer, Bpay, Credit/Debit Card, Skrill, Paypal and Poli', '[]', '2005', NULL, NULL, 0, '2019-07-09 20:25:10', '2019-07-09 20:25:10'),

Opening up its operations in 1997 and going online a year later in 1998 was a smart move from the team behind Unibet, establishing itself as one of the first online sportsbooks around. In Australia, only the sports betting feature of this website is available, which is why we will only be talking about Sportsbook in this review. By the players for the players, that’s what their motto states and this is quite evident in the refreshing look of their webpage as well as its easily navigable interface; no wonder it has won a number of prestigious awards. \n\n \n\nThe company is Swedish owned and therefore naturally excels in the Scandinavian market, but it definitely doesn’t stop there. Unibet operates in over 100 countries, has over 14 million regular users and to make sure that all of those users’ needs are met, their website is available in 20 languages. At this point, we think you’re starting to get what we meant when we said underrated. \n\n \n\nWelcome Bonus\n\nWe wouldn’t get too excited about this if we were you; the welcome bonus does not amount to much, but it’s more than enough to get you started. Upon signing up, Unibet offers £30 in risk-free bets which you can use; however, you will have to wager that amount by 5 times in order to be able to officially claim any of it. Not going to lie, a bit disappointing for such a large sportsbook, but their strengths lie elsewhere, and they are more than enough to make up for an otherwise disappointing welcome bonus. \n\n \n\nEvent Selection\n\nDid you read the part about how the welcome bonus might not be so great, but Unibet more than makes up for it in other areas? Well, this is where it makes up for it. They offer some really competitive odds, and not on just your typical sports, but even less common ones. Given their background, we would expect them to excel in football odds, especially in Nordic leagues, which is where they offer their best odds, but their advantageous wagers extend to more than that. \n\n \n\nUnibet’s sports book basically covers all the major EU and USA sports events. Horse Racing, Cricket, Golf, Tennis, you name it. In case you can’t see your sport of choice on the handy left side column, the “all sports” tab will lead you to a larger list of niche sports, some of which we have never even heard of ourselves. If that doesn’t scream ‘spoilt for choice’, we don’t know what does. \n\n \n\nAt any moment in time, there are thousands of odds readily available for you to place your bet on. Odds can be displayed in three formats: decimal, fractional and American, whatever you’re most comfortable with. It’s not just a matter of seeing a game you like and deciding to place a bet; this online sports betting company actually helps you make as much of an informed decision as you ever will in such scenarios. Selecting an event will also give you information on how the teams involved have fared in recent similar events, also giving you each player’s position and performance in previous matches. Impressive huh?\n\n \n\nLive Option \n\nIf you’ve placed a bet on any match, you’re automatically given access to the live streaming of the event you’ve bet on. Unibet even have a live betting option, which lets you place your bets while the match is ongoing. If live stream is not available, don’t fret! You can always check their live score updates to find out what’s going on. \n\n \n\nMobile Betting \n\nDo you have a solid internet connection? Then you can place your bets on any platform, including mobile. Through your phone, you have access to live and pre-match betting, statistics, and live-scores, basically all of the sports betting essentials. Unibet even has an app that you can download from apple or play store. \n\n \n\nPayment\n\nWith 20 years of experience under their belt, you can bet that payment security will be top notch with Unibet. The website accepts 13 different currencies and you can process your payments through: VISA, Mastercard, Paysafe Card, Skrill, Neteller, Trustly. As with many other sports books of its kind, the withdrawal method has to be the same as the one you’ve used to deposit. \n\n \n\nThe maximum payout per day is £100,000 and withdrawals in general can take up to seven days to be processed. \n\n \n\nCustomer Support\n\nThroughout the years, Unibet have gotten a lot of backlash for the way they have approached customer care. Many have complained about the time it takes for the sportsbook to get back to clients with answers to their queries and problems. Phone lines are not 24/7 and more often than not, emails might take longer than 24 hours to be replied; not exactly what you’d want out of your sports booker of choice. \n\n \n\nHaving said that, they do have a live chat option that is offered in multiple languages, which is not something that everyone offers. They also have quite an extensive FAQ page, which answers every beginner’s question. \n\n \n\nSecurity \n\nA typical sportsbook is usually licensed by one main authority; Unibet is licenced by three: The Malta Gaming Authority, Remote Gambling Commission of the Government of Gibraltar and Alderney Gaming Commission. Apart from being a pretty endorsed Sports book, it also shows you the kind of standard they approach security with; a great quality for a platform that you’re considering trusting your money with, if you ask us. Above all that, user information is encrypted, so it really can’t get any safer. \n\n \n\nFinal Remarks\n\nWhile many seem to have a love-hate relationship with this particular Sports book, we’ve come to the conclusion that the good definitely outweighs the bad here. Yes, they might have an average level Customer Service, and yes, they might not even have the best welcome bonus around, but would you give up competitive and informed odds on a vast selection of events and games for that? At the end of the day, you win money by placing bets on odds, and when odds can’t get much better than what Unibet is offering, the choice of sports book is still a no brainer to us. \n\n ', '', ' Bulgarian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish', 'VISA, Mastercard, Paysafe Card, Skrill, Neteller, Trustly.', '[]', '1998', NULL, NULL, 0, '2019-07-09 20:25:16', '2019-07-09 20:25:16'),

We will only be talking about Sportsbook in this review.\n\nAnother strong point? Consistently competitive odds displayed on one of the simplest interfaces you’ll ever encounter. The platform displays so much information on its homepage that it might cause the website to slow down a bit sometimes, but that’s such a small price to pay in comparison to the convenience of having all your favourite sports odds and results displayed on one page. \n\nSport Event Options\n\n \n\nThink of a sport. Any sport. The weirdest, most uncommon sport that you can possibly think of. Have you got it? Is it still being played in this day and age? If the answer is yes, just go to the Bet365 left side bar and chances are, it’ll be right there waiting for you, with a number of odds that you can bet on. That’s how extensive the event selection on the Bet365 website is.  Well, maybe we’re exaggerating a tiny tiny bit, but the choice truly is vast, that we guarantee. \n\n \n\nPlacing your Wager\n\nApart from having an impressive selection of sports, Bet365 makes it extremely easy for you to find your sport of interest and place your wager on it. If we’re being honest, this is probably something they’ll benefit off more than you; I mean, you see some event odds, get all excited and place your bet at the touch of a button … let’s say this feature will probably benefit one party a bit more than the other, but that’s barely anything we can complain about.\n\n \n\nWhen it comes to placing your bets, you can do it in any way you like, whatever floats your boat.  There is a specifically tailored \"Bet Builder\" feature. This feature allows for the player to seamlessly place their bets before the match even starts. \n\n The Quick Code option allows for a faster betting experience, you can place your In-Play single from your phone. The Each Way Extra feature allows for players to bet one selected UK and Irish horseraces. \n\n \n\nPayment Options:\n\nBet365 is famous for its impressively fast payouts. As for the rest, the typical couple days waiting time is expected. When making a deposit or withdrawal using this site, you can make use of a wide array of payment methods. On-site features include: Bet365 Visa Card, wihich gives the player instant access to withdraw any winnings.  The \"Cash Top Up Card\" can be used to make a deposit on the player\'s Bet365 account balance.\n\n \n\nLive Streaming Options:\n\nUnder Australian law, we are required to inform you that Live Streaming on bet365 is exempt from Parts 3 and 4 of the Broadcasting Services (Online Content Service Provider Rules) 2018.\n\n \n\nCustomer Support: \n\nCustomer Support with Bet365 is efficient and friendly; it is also offered in multiple languages and you can contact. In retrospect, sending an online betting company a strongly worded letter, might not be your go-to communication of choice but doesn’t it just feel great knowing that you have the option? \n\n \n\nFinal Remarks: \n\nThere’s not much left to say except for the fact that we are 100% served by everything and anything that Bet365 has to offer. With a portfolio of event choices as extensive as theirs, you don’t have to scratch your head for long before realising that it is the best go-to option for all your sports booking needs. ', '', '', '', '[]', '2001', NULL, NULL, 0, '2019-07-09 20:25:23', '2019-07-09 20:25:23'),

The only thing you need to when creating an “account” at No Account Casino is click on the “Deposit Money” and fill in the amount you wish to start playing with. The transaction will be done through the Trustly payment solution, meaning that you might need an account there in order to access your bank balance. However, once you have used Trustly’s safe and secure banking platform, No Account Casino will save your balance in the browser of your device through Trustly\'s database. This means that your account will be directly created on your browser. If you are idle in the browser or close the browser, your balance will be saved. So if you decided to close your laptop and come back later, your money (and perhaps any winnings) will still be there!\n\nWelcome Offer At No Account Casino\n\nBeing able to deposit and play instantly is a nice and dandy feature that No Account Casino has. But how does it weigh up against normal casinos in terms of welcome bonuses and offers? Most online casinos offer their new players a deposit bonus or a match-up bonus. Sometimes these deposit bonuses are spread out over several deposits, allowing for the player to have a limited amount of bonus options. What can also be deemed a bummer with these deposit bonus is that there are usually high wagering requirements attached to the match up bonuses.\n \nWe already know that No Account Casino is no ordinary casino, which is why they do not offer ordinary bonuses either. There is no deposit offer waiting for you here, instead there is a very attractive cashback offer available for everyone. The best thing about it is, you do not even need to deposit any funds in order to be eligible for the cashback offer. Every Thursday ALL players will receive a 10% cashback of an accumulative pot created from losses of players from the previous week. Players who have played slots of live casino games and haven’t won anything in that week will be eligible for the 10% cashback. This happens every week of the year, can you believe it?!\n\nWhich Games Can I Play At No Account Casino?\n\nSo far we have covered all the amazing benefits of No Account Casino, but the most important part of an online casino is the variety and quality of casino games they have on offer. No Account Casino luckily is on par with their repertoire of slot machines and live dealer games with big names like Casumo and Guts Casino.

However, once these resources are exhausted, there really is not much that keeps Clover Casino interesting.

Malta is famous for housing many trustworthy and prestigious online casinos such as LeoVegas, Casumo, Mr Green and many others. How RoyalSlots weighs up against the competition is something we will find out in this casino review. \n\nPlay Safe and Secure at RoyalSlots\n\nAccording to their own statement on the website, RoyalSlots claims to put security at the forefront of their policies. As part of securing their product and making RoyalSlots a credible and safe casino to play at, this online casino has gone through the process of obtaining two licences in two different jurisdictions. \n\nRoyalSlots Casino is licenced and regulated in Malta by the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) under licence number: MGA/B2C/410/2017. Likewise, RoyalSlots Casino is licenced and regulated in the United Kingdom by the UK Gambling Commission under licence number: 48756. This makes this online casino very approachable and user-friendly for a massive player base, especially those in the European Union and the United Kingdom.\n\nWith RoyalSlots being audited by two heavyweight authorities within the gambling industry, this online casino shows that it can be trusted and is true to its word.\n\nHow Do I Open An Account at RoyalSlots? \n\nOpening an account at RoyalSlots Casino is as easy as pie. Simply navigate your way to the top of the page and click on “Create Account”. Here you will be prompted to fill out your personal details, which only takes a minute, and you will be on your way. \n\nCasino Bonuses at RoyalSlots Casino\n\nGoing with the whole simplistic and toned down theme of RoyalSlots, this online casino does not offer many bonuses or offers to benefit from. There are the occasional monthly offers or campaigns that run from a certain time to time. Then there is the four-tier welcome offer, which consists of a deposit match up bonus. This is to welcome new players into the casino. There is a Monday Reload bonus up for grabs as well, allowing players to seamlessly top up their bankroll and make the most out of their experience at RoyalSlots Casino. \n\nWelcome Bonus at RoyalSlots Casino (EU and ROW)\n\nAs stated above, the welcome bonus at RoyalSlots Casino consists of four bonus tiers. After players have finished creating their account, they will have the option to claim their first bonus. This bonus consists of a so-called “deposit match-up” bonus, which means that the casino will match the amount deposited up to a certain percentage. This is the same for the second, third and fourth deposit that the player will make. Below you will find an overview of how each deposit bonus works: \n\n\n	Deposit Bonus 1: 100% up to €200\n	Deposit Bonus 2: 50% up to €200\n	Deposit Bonus 3: 25% up to €300\n	Deposit Bonus 4: 25% up to €300\n\n\nWelcome Bonus at RoyalSlots Casino (UK)\n\nPlayers based in the UK are in luck, they will also receive a spectacular welcome offer which encompasses the same amount as their EU peers:\n\n\n	Deposit Bonus 1: 100% up to £200\n	Deposit Bonus 2: 50% up to £200\n	Deposit Bonus 3: 25% up to £300\n	Deposit Bonus 4: 25% up to £300\n\n\nPlease note that all bonuses come with a wagering requirement of 40x and players will have 30 days to complete them. \n\nWhat Games Are Available at RoyalSlots Casino?\n\nThe selection of slots and table games available at RoyalSlots is rather decent. After all, this casino is called “RoyalSlots”, so you would expect them to live up to their name. Providing games by both large casino software providers as well as small-scale game studios, RoyalSlots is able to offer a myriad of different casino games, making sure that every player can find a game they enjoy playing.\n\nAvailable game providers are: Big Time Gaming, Scientific Games and its game studios, NetEnt, NYX, Play\'n Go, Thunderkick, IGT and BluePrint Gaming.\n\n\n\nWhich Banking Methods Can I Use at RoyalSlots Casino?\n\nRoyalSlots Casino has diligently made sure that they offer only trusted and secure banking methods to make sure that all transactions are completed in a safe and timely manner. Players can make use of the well-known banking methods such as credit cards and bank transfer, while also having the option to use e-wallets or prepaid credit cards to deposit or withdraw their funds.\n\nAvailable deposit methods are: Visa, MasterCard/Maestro, Bank transfer, Skrill, Neteller and PaysafeCard. \nAvailable withdrawal methods are: Visa, MasterCard/Maestro, Bank transfer, Skrill, Neteller and PaysafeCard. \n\nAll deposits and withdrawals made through these methods are instant and are not subjected to any hidden fees. For every transaction there is a minimum requirement of £10 and a maximum limit of £5000. \n\nPlease note that the bank transfer options will have a processing time of 3 to 5 days.\n\nRoyalSlots Casino on Mobile\n\nRoyalSlots Casino is not recommended for mobile use. One reason is because they do not offer a mobile app for Android or iOS and the second reason is that the website itself feels rather clumsy on mobile. While RoyalSlots is responsive and shows fine on the screen, the slot section feels odd to deal with. Especially if you want to have a browse, you constantly need to click on a “show more” button to see the next batch of games. \n\nCustomer Support Information\n\nAnother point where RoyalSlots seems to blunder is the customer support section. While they do offer an FAQ section, the content within seems generic and sparse. It does not provide players with accurate or helpful information besides telling them how to deposit or open an account. There also is no direct phone number available and the support can be contacted through a ticket system (which is notoriously slow) or the live chat option. \n\nThe quality of the live chat option remains dubious. \n\nA Final Word on RoyalSlots\n\nWhile the selection of slots and the welcome package is very decent decent, the other features of the website are nothing spectacular. RoyalSlots does cater to a very broad international audience, with their two licences allowing players from all over the world to sign up. However, the banking options are rather sparse to cater to international players, with only Interac being an option for Canadian players for example. Weak performance on mobile and a questionable ticket system for customer support, RoyalSlots does not seem to put its best foot forward here. We are hoping to see improvements here, other than that RoyalSlots is a decent online casino to play at and might be appealing for players who like a minimalistic approach.', 'BetDigital Gaming,&nbsp;Big Time Gaming,&nbsp;Merkur Gaming,&nbsp;Microgaming,&nbsp;Net Entertainment,&nbsp;NextGen Gaming,&nbsp;NYX Gaming,&nbsp;Quickspin,&nbsp;Red Tiger Gaming,&nbsp;Scientific Games,&nbsp;Thunderkick,&nbsp;WMS&nbsp;', 'English', 'Bank Transfer,&nbsp;Credit Card,&nbsp;Neteller,&nbsp;Skrill,&nbsp;Trustly&nbsp;', '[\"Up To \\u20ac1000 Welcome Package\",\"Bonus code: <\\/strong><strong class=\\\"red-text\\\">Not Required\"]', '2018', NULL, NULL, 0, '2019-07-09 20:27:58', '2019-07-09 20:27:58'),

Hyper Casino is a fully fledged online casino and comes loaded with the full spectrum of casino games, ranging from online slots to live casino and everything in between. L&L Europe Limited has plenty of experience setting up and managing online casinos and the team is aware of the fact that for a casino to be successful, it needs to have a good selection of games or risk losing players to competitors. \n\nIt’s all about quality at Hyper Casino and players will be delighted to discover that they only work with the best game providers in the industry to ensure the experience is on par with some of the best online casinos out there.

All online slot players are looking to take home the big bucks without having the need to break the bank and one of the most lucrative ways of doing so is by spinning the reels of jackpot slots. Jackpot slots have the ability to reward players with six, seven and even eight digit figure prizes with a couple of spins, if lady luck is present, that is.

The biggest jackpot slots available at Hyper Casino include Mega Moolah, Major Millions, Mega Fortune and Arabian Nights. \n\n \n\n \n\nLive Casino and Table Games\n\nPlayers’ needs are diverse and casino operators need to be aware of the fact that spinning the reels is not for everyone and they have a higher chance of attracting players if the full portfolio of casino games are available.

Mongoose casinos have a total of 14 tables games to choose from, split evenly between the two timeless classics, blackjack and roulette. The reasons why there are multiples of each table game are because there are variations, each with a slight different take on the games and so cater for players with different budgets. \n\n \n\nCustomer Support at Mongoose Casino\n\nCustomer support is one of the main pillars of any online casino and its reliability will determine whether its future.

The following are the deposit and withdrawal methods accepted by Mongoose casino:\n\n\n	Skrill\n	Neteller\n	Ecopays\n	Paysafecard\n	Flexepin\n	Neosurf\n	Bank Transfer\n	Instadebit\n	Visa\n	Mastercard\n	Bitcoin\n\n\nMongoose Casino Summary\n\nMongoose casino has got a lot of good things going for it, particularly the huge selection of games, the sites’ ease of use and the lucrative welcome bonus.

In this review, we’ll delve a little deeper into what Slotty Vegas has to offer with regards to the games available, the welcome package offered to new players, the quality of the customer support, as well as the deposit and withdrawal methods accepted. \n\nFull Range of Casino Games\n\nCasino players join an online casino for one main reason only - to play casino games, and if there isn’t a good selection, they won’t hesitate to take their business elsewhere. This is why online casinos work with the best payment providers to ensure the gaming experience is second to none. \n\nIf slots are your cup of tea, you’re going to be delighted with Slotty Vegas’ selection of games. Video slots come in abundance and if you’re an experienced player and looking for a particular game, the search function is sure to come in handy. All the games are segregated into game lobbies to make it easier for players to get to their favourite game types and if you’re unsure of what slot to play, head over to our slot reviews, where we’ll discuss all the elements of the games to give you a better understanding of what to expect. Some of the most popular slots available at Slotty Vegas include Thunderstruck 2, Jumanji, Dead or Alive and NetEnt’s game changer, Gonzo’s Quest, to name a few. \n\nTable Games\n\nTable games are huge part of an online casino and it’s essential to have a selection for those players who don’t enjoy spinning the reels for hours on end. After all, table games are the true definition of any casino. Table games differ to live casino games (which we’ll talk about a bit later in this review) in the way that they are played against a machine and not a real, live dealer. Table games are all about the thrill they deliver and the fast paced action of the games. It would be a sin for any online casino not to stock the classics, such as blackjack and roulette and Slotty Vegas take their selection to the next level by having game variants to ensure there are tables to suit all budgets. Slotty Vegas a total of 32 table games to choose from, all powered by some of the best game providers in the industry. \n\nLive Casino\n\nLive Casino has got to be one of the most electrifying areas of any live casino because of the fact that it replicates the traditional brick and mortar casino experience perfectly by streaming the games directly to your desktop or mobile device. All games are streamed in stunning HD quality and in real time and played against a real, live dealer. Since the games are played live, it’s impossible to speed up or slow down the pace of the game, like you would in regular table games. Unfortunately, Slotty Vegas only has a selection of seven live casino games to choose from, all of which are split between blackjack and roulette tables. \n\nThe Welcome Package\n\nThis is where it gets interesting. Players who sign-up to Slotty Vegas will be eligible for a welcome package consisting of a 100% up to £/$/€500 + 50 Free Spins to use on Book of Dead by Play \'n Go. This means that if you make a deposit of £100 you’ll have an extra £100 to play with, but the bonus funds come with a set of terms of conditions that must be respected in order for the bonus to remain active. This is why we encourage all players to read over any terms and conditions before accepting a promotion from any online casino. \n\nAll The Support You Need\n\nWhether you’re a newbie to online casino or a veteran, there comes a time where you’ll need to get in touch with a customer support agent about a problem you might be having and there’s nothing more reassuring than having a reliable team of people ready to assist. The best way to get in touch is through the live chat function where you’ll get assistance in real time. The other, more traditional way of getting in touch is via email. \n\nDeposit and Withdrawal Methods\n\nWhen a casino player has made the decision to trust a site, the last thing they expect is friction when making a deposit or withdrawal. Problems when depositing or withdrawing is guaranteed to leave players looking for an alternative online casino, which is why Slotty Vegas choose to work with the best game providers in the industry to ensure this never happens. The following are the payment methods accepted by Slotty Vegas:\n\n\n	Entercash\n	Euteller\n	Giropay\n	iDeal\n	SafetyPay\n	Visa\n	Mastercard\n	Astropay\n\n\nFinal Verdict \n\nSlotty Vegas has all the elements in place to make it a household name; hundreds of games to choose from, live casino, live chat support, a huge welcome bonus and is regulated by the best regulators in the industry.

One of the most important factors to consider when gambling online is the regulating body overlooking online casinos.\n\nFor instance, Cozino Casino is regulated by the Malta Gaming Authority, a well respected regulating body and one which imposes rigorous checks to ensure players are always protected when gambling online. Even at first glance, it’s blatantly clear that Cozino casino has a lot to offer and in this review, we’ll be covering all the elements you should be factoring in when making your decision. \n\n \n\nThe Selection of Games\n\nOnline casino sites can be as aesthetically pleasing as they want, but without a sufficient database of casino games, players won’t think twice to take their business over to a competitor. Players’ needs are very diverse and for an online casino to stand a chance in the long run, they need a  healthy selection of games. Cozino casino only work with the best game providers, such as NetEnt, Microgaming and Yggdrasil to ensure the gaming experience is second to none. \n\n \n\nOnline Slots\n\nOnline slots make up most of the games at Cozino casino, as is the case with most online casinos and if you’re a slot aficionado, you’ll be delighted to discover that there’s over 350 online slots to get your fix from. Some of the player favourites available to play at Cozino casino include Gonzo’s Quest, Vikings Go To Hell, Valley of the Gods and Dark Vortex, to name a few. Return to player, or RTP is a percentage of how much the slot pays out to the player, so be sure to choose the highest RTP games. In our online slot reviews, we always list the RTP and the volatility of the slot, to give you a better of what to expect out of the game. \n\n \n\nJackpot Slots\n\nJackpot slots are revered by casino players because they give rise to the opportunity of taking home the big bucks from a couple of spins. There have been many times where players triggered a multi million Euro jackpot in less than five minutes and if history repeats itself, there’s no reason to believe that it won’t happen to you. By no means are we saying that’s easy, but if lady luck is on your side, you could be laughing all the way to the bank. \n\nJackpot slots can be twofold: Fixed jackpots, where the jackpot prize will be unchanged, regardless of how frequently it’s triggered. Fixed jackpot prizes start and end at a certain amount and will never change. Progressive jackpots, on the other hand, will keep increasing in size as more players spin the reels. Each spin takes a miniscule percentage and is put in a collective pot where players from different online casinos will be competing against each other. Once triggered, the jackpot prize will restart from its minimum amount and keep increasing as more players tune in. \n\nSome of the biggest slots available to play at Cozino casino include Arabian Nights, Mega Moolah, Cleopatra and Major Millions. \n\n \n\nTable Games and Live Casino\n\nThe more diverse the selection of games, the higher the chance of retaining and keeping players happy. Table games are played against a machine, as opposed to Live casino games, which are played against a real live dealer. Table games are always very speedy and full of action, but you have the option to slow down the action from the game settings. \n\nLive Casino replicates the land-based experience perfectly by streaming table games directly to your laptop or mobile device in pristine HD quality. The experience is heightened by the dedicated chat box which allows players to communicate with the dealer, just like at a land-based casino, but be aware that any profanity or insults aimed at the dealer will get you banned from the online casino altogether. \n\nRoulette, Blackjack, Baccarat and Casino Hold’em are just a few of the games available to play at Cozino casino, but with over 40 live casino games readily available, you’re guaranteed to never experience a dull moment. \n\n \n\nThe Welcome Package\n\nThe welcome package at Cozino casino is slightly different. Instead of the traditional deposit bonus, the online casino will reward players with a free spin for every €1 deposited up to a maximum of 100 spins. In other words, the maximum amount of free spins that can be awarded through the welcome package is 100 spins. \n\nCozino casino runs daily promotions throughout the year, which can include free spins and deposit bonuses which have a 24 hour expiry, specifically aimed at existing players, so all players can enjoy the gravy train. \n\n \n\nSupport When You Need It Most\n\nCustomer support is one of the main pillars of any online casino and any negative experience can have a detrimental effect on the casinos’ reputation. If you encounter any queries or problems when playing at Cozino casino, send over an email and the team will be prompt in dealing with anything you’re facing. The support team is available round the clock, so you can rest assured that your query will be dealt with in a timely manner. \n\nThe team also crafted a set of frequently asked questions that many players have in common in order to save you time getting in touch with an agent. You’ll be able to find queries relating to a number of topics, including but not limited to payment methods, bonus issues, account related queries and technical issues. \n\n \n\nPayment Methods Accepted By Cozino Casino\n\nCasino players will agree that anything less than seamless and speedy transactions is a way to deter them away from any online casino, which is most online casino, including Cozino casino, work with the best payment providers in the industry to ensure no friction is caused when depositing or withdrawing funds to and from your account. The following is a list of payment methods accepted by Cozino casino:\n\n\n	Visa\n	Mastercard\n	Neteller\n	Sofort\n	Skrill\n	Paysafecard\n\n\n \n\nCozino Casino Summed Up\n\nHere at CasinoTopsOnline, all the online casinos we review are tried and tested in order to be able to give a true and fair view of what to expect. We can safely say that Cozino casino has got all the elements in place of a well established casino and we can’t think of a plausible reason why players would overlook such an all rounded online casino. It comes packed with over 500 casino games, including online and jackpot slots, table games and enough live dealer games to make you forget land-based casinos ever existed. \n ', '1X2 Network ,&nbsp;Microgaming,&nbsp;Net Entertainment,&nbsp;Play’n GO,&nbsp;Quickspin,&nbsp;Yggdrasil Gaming&nbsp;', 'English, German, Finnish, French, Norwegian ', 'Credit Card,&nbsp;PaysafeCard,&nbsp;SOFORT,&nbsp;Neteller,&nbsp;Skrill&nbsp;', '[\"1 Free Spin Per \\u20ac1 Deposited Up To 100 Free Spins\",\"Bonus code: <\\/strong><strong class=\\\"red-text\\\">COZINO100\",\"For every \\u20ac1 you deposit, Cozino Casino will grant you 1 free spin up to a maximum of 100 spins.

In this review, we’ll delve into the most important elements to consider in your decision making process and one which should never be overlooked is the regulating body. LadyLucks is regulated by the UK Gambling Commission and for a casino to acquire a gambling license, it must go through rigorous checks to ensure all aspects of the online casino all up to standard.\n\nPlayers can rest assured that if an online casino is regulated by the UK Gambling Commission or the Malta Gaming Authority, their safety and security is safeguarded when gambling online. Other elements discussed in this review include the selection of games, the welcome bonus, the reliability of the customer support department and the payment methods accepted.  \n\n \n\nGame Selection at LadyLucks Casino\n\nOnline casinos know that players needs are diverse and so must be the game selection in order to satisfy each and every one.

Some of the player favourites available to play at LadyLucks casino include Dead or Alive, Blood Suckers 2, Siberian Storm and the ever so popular, Starburst, to name a few. \n\nEach and every slot game has ‘i’ symbol on the bottom right of the thumbnail image and when clicked, it takes you to a detailed review of the game to help you get acquainted with the game and what to expect from the online slot. \n\n \n\nJackpot slots\n\nThis is where you’ll need lady luck on your side, as jackpot slots have the ability to send players into financial freedom with the gargantuan jackpots some of them have. Jackpot slots can either have fixed jackpots, where the prize remains unchanged regardless of how many players are playing the game and of the frequency it’s won. For instance, if a game has a fixed jackpot of €50,000, it will remain unchanged as long as the game is live. \n\nProgressive slots, on the other hand, have their jackpot sizes increase with every spin. A tiny percentage is taken from every spin, regardless at which casino the game is being played and is put into a collective pot. Mega Moolah, nicknamed the ‘millionaire maker’ has broken numerous records over the years for the largest payouts ever awarded to players, some of which exceeded eight digit payouts. The biggest jackpot slots available to play at LadyLucks casino are Mega Fortune, Wolf Run and Cleopatra. \n\n \n\nTable Games\n\nSpinning the reels isn’t for everyone and it’s essential for online casinos to have a healthy selection of table games to ensure no players are lost to competitors. There are a total of 28 games to choose from, including all the table classics such as roulette and blackjack, but players can also enjoy baccarat games and video poker. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nThe Welcome Package\n\nThis is where it gets interesting. Players who sign up to LadyLucks casino for the first time will be eligible for a welcome package consisting of a 100% deposit bonus up to £100 and 100 Welcome spins to sweeten the deal. We can safely say that the welcome package offered to new players is beyond generous but keep in mind that every welcome package, bonus and promotion has a set of terms and conditions which need to be adhered to in order for the promotion to remain active.\n\nAny breaches to the T & C’s might result in confiscation of the bonus money, so it’s pertinent to read over them before opting in. \n\nBut the gravy train doesn’t stop there, LadyLucks casino runs a number of promotions throughout the year aimed specifically at existing players. These range from bonus spins, cashbacks and seasonal promotions, so make sure to take advantage of them once a member of LadyLucks casino. \n\n \n\nCustomer Support \n\nThe most efficient way of getting in touch with a support agent at LadyLucks casino is through their live chat function.

The other, more traditional way of getting in touch is through email, by filling out a form which can be found in the ‘Contact Us’ page. \n\n \n\nPayment Methods Accepted by LadyLucks Casino\n\nPayment processing is one area where online casinos cannot afford to drop the ball as any friction experienced in this delicate time will undoubtedly send players flocking to competitors. This is why all casino operators work with the best payment providers in the industry to ensure this never happens.

We are here to announce a brand-spanking new online casino named after the phrase you’ll utter when you hit that jackpot: LuckyDays! This newly established casino will fall under the Gaming Innovation group whitelabel platform. This means that we can expect great bonuses, super-fast payouts, and the best slot machine titles. Launched in 2019 this new brand had us on the edge of our seats until it became available to the gambling public.\n\nLicenced under the Curacao Government, the casino is able to accept players from Europe, New Zealand, Canada and even Japan. That is quite an audience to please! However, players from the United Kingdom; prepare yourself for a damper, because it’s not your lucky day at LuckyDays. The casino cannot accept players from your country yet. Don’t worry, we have tons of great online casinos just for you UK players. \n\nCasino Bonuses at LuckyDays\n\nEvery day is your lucky day at this casino. Being part of GiG’s platform, we can expect some seriously great casino bonuses at LuckyDays. When looking at hot shots like Rizk and Guts casino, we can see that both these brands offers fantastic online casino bonuses tailored to slot players and live casino fanatics alike. It is is no surprise that LuckyDays will cross the bridge with similar offers; making sure that players with different game preferences get the best bonus to fit their style of playing. \n\nWelcome Package at LuckyDays Casino\n\nOnline casinos that fall under Gaming Innovation Group are well known for their multi-tier welcome packages. These welcome packages come with so-called matchup deposit bonuses. We see a very solid match-up bonus for LuckyDays casino, namely a total welcome package of €1000 in bonus funds and 200 free spins.\n\nIn addition to that, LuckyDays will most likely not keep it at one meagre deposit bonus, but will make it a complete welcome package by adding three separate deposit bonuses. This means that players can keep coming back for a top-up on their bank balance should their first bonus have run out. \n\nAvailable Casino Games and Slot Machines\n\nLuckyDays carries a wide variety of top-notch slot machines and casino games, from a range of different providers. By being part of a whitelabel, this new casino does not need to go through the back-breaking work of striking up deals with software providers, that has already been done for them. Having said that, you will experience some great industry titles at LuckyDays Casino, including popular names such as Net Entertainment, Microgaming, Red Tiger Gaming, Pragmatic Play, iSoftbet, Play\'n Go, and Quickspin. \n\nOf course, we also see some small-scale independent game studios make a debut here. Up and coming software providers such as RabCat, StormCraft Studios and GiG Games are taking the industry by storm as we speak. More and more players seem to prefer playing high-quality games made by independent game studios since they are able to provide much more attention to detail. You don’t believe me? Try out Book of Souls and see for yourself. \n\nLive Casino Games\n\nEvolution Gaming seems to be the go-to game studio for all live dealer games. It is no surprise that LuckyDays has implemented their highly renowned games in its repertoire as well. This live dealer game studio based in Malta is renowned for their professional croupiers and high-quality stream services. This allows players to enjoy live blackjack, roulette and baccarat from the comfort of their own home.\n\nThe provider also carriers several niche-orientated games such as Lightning Roulette and Dream Catcher. \n\n\n\nWhich Payment Methods Can I Use LuckyDays?\n\nBecause LuckyDays seems to cater to a broad audience of people from all corners of the world, it is  imperative that this new online casino is able to offer a wide range of different banking option. On top of that, LuckyDays also needs to make sure it can accept the currencies from all these different nations, such as EUR, CAD, NZD, SEK, NOK and JPY. \n\nWhen it comes down to making safe deposit and withdrawals, this casino makes sure to offer banking options every player feels comfortable using. In order to achieve this, they offer the following deposit and withdrawal methods: Bank Transfer, Visa, Mastercard, Skrill, Neteller and Ecopayz. \n\nWithdrawal Times at LuckyDays\n\nAgain, being part of the GiG whitelabel platform, LuckyDays has all the necessary infrastructure in place to make sure are withdrawals are processed in a timely manner. After all, nobody likes having to wait for their winnings to appear in their bank account.\n\nWith banking options such as Ecopayz and E-wallets, withdrawals can be completed instantly. However, for players who wish to withdraw directly to their bank account, their withdrawal is subjected to their bank’s payment processing times, which is usually 3 to 5 business days. \n\nCustomer Support Information\n\nHaving an in-house customer support team would mean that players at LuckyDays Casino can expect professional and friendly support for all their queries. The support team can be reached through the live chat function on the website itself. If you are strapped for time then you can consult their FAQ.\n\nA Final Word on LuckyDays Casino\n\nCount your lucky stars and have a great time at LuckyDays Casino, as this new brand is set to take the industry by storm with it\'s elegant and simplistic deisgn. The casino boasts a very generous welcome bonus and staggering amount of free spins, this allows players to take LuckyDays for a test drive before settling in.

Available game studios are: Play ‘n Go, Pragmatic Play, Microgaming, OGS, NoLimit City, Net Entertainment, Yggdrasil and Playson.\n\nTheir selection of live dealer games is mostly powered by the famous Evolution Gaming studio; who are well known for their top quality streaming services and in-house trained croupiers, who are dedicated to giving you the most authentic live casino experience from the comfort of your own home. \n\nThe most classic live dealer games are of course available, giving the player the option to choose from Roulette, Blackjack, Baccarat and Casino Hold’em. Several niche games are also available such as Lightning Roulette and Dream Catcher. \n\n\n\nWhich Payment Methods Can I use?\n\nSince Mango Casino is a sole no-account / pay ‘n play casino, they can only accept deposits and withdrawals through Trustly for those making use of the service. This is because the pay ‘n play mechanic is only available through Trustly, since they are the creators of the platform. While inconvenient to some, this is only to ensure that players can safely use the pay ‘n play function without the interference of third parties.\n\nHowever, this means that only European residents will be able to make use of the Trustly payment method, as the Stockholm-based banking company only caters to this demographic. Good news for Europeans, their deposit and withdrawals will be processed instantly, meaning there is more time to play and less time waiting on your transaction to clear. \n\nPlayer from outside of Europe will be able to fund their non-pay ‘n play account with either a Visa, Mastercard, Neteller or Skrill account.\n\nFunds can be withdrawn from a minimum of €20, GBP20, SEK 200 or NOK 200 and is capped at €2000, GBP2000, SEK 20000 or NOK 20000.\n\nCustomer Service Information\n\nWe understand that there can be some doubts when making use of one of the fancy-schmancy new no-account casinos. This is why Mango Casino has a dedicated in-house customer support team who can be contacted through either the online form on the website or send them an email to support@mangocasino.com.\n\nThe only downside is there is no live chat function at Mango Casino yet, meaning that you will have to wait for a response from any of their representatives should you have an urgent query.\n\nOwnership and Licences\n\nMango Casino is operated by Viral Interactive Limited, an iGaming company that also owns other no-account casinos such as Bajungo Casino. They are in possession of licences in three different jurisdictions, allowing them to operate legally. Mango Casino is licensed by the Malta Gaming Authority, the Swedish Spelinspektionen and the UK Gambling Commission. \n\nA Final Word on Mango Casino\n\nHere at CasinoTopsOnline we love the concept of their no-account casinos, but we hope to see these casinos offer their services to players based outside of Europe as well. While players outside of Europe can still register at Mango Casino, they are missing out on the speedy pay ‘n play feature because it simply has not been integrated outside of Europe yet due to the BankID being necessary. Other than that, Mango Casino offers a very solid repertoire of different slot machines and live casino games. The daily bonuses are a great way of keeping the thrill alive and make sure players come back for more. ', 'Betsoft Gaming,&nbsp;Habanero Gaming,&nbsp;Microgaming,&nbsp;Net Entertainment,&nbsp;Play’n GO,&nbsp;Pragmatic Play,&nbsp;Yggdrasil Gaming&nbsp;', 'English, Swedish, German, Finnish', 'Trustly&nbsp;', '[\"Daily Bonuses for every day of the week\",\"Bonus code: <\\/strong><strong class=\\\"red-text\\\">Not Required\",\"Sign up at  Mango Casino and find out what bonuses are waiting for you.

In this review, we’ll take a closer look at all the elements that make up Bootlegger Casino, including a detailed analysis of the games available, the welcome bonus, the reliability of the customer support, as well as the payment methods accepted. \n\n \n\nThe Welcome Package \n\nCompetition is stiff in the online casino industry and the welcome package offered to new players is an opportunity to flex and differentiate themselves from the competition. Bootlegger casino took a different stance with their offerings, splitting their welcome package in three deposits to further entice players. The following is a breakdown of the welcome package offered to all new players:\n\n \n\nFirst Deposit\n\nIt’s uncommon to encounter a welcome package as generous as the one being offered by Bootlegger casino, but there really is no catch. Players who make their first deposit to Bootlegger casino will benefit from a 100% deposit bonus of up to €100 coupled with 100 spins. This means that any deposit you make will be doubled, up to a maximum of €100. To be eligible for the welcome bonus, a minimum deposit of €20 must be made. The spins granted in the welcome bonus can be enjoyed on a number of games, all of which are listed in the terms and conditions of the offer. \n\n \n\nSecond Deposit\n\nWhen making your second deposit at Bootlegger casino, you’ll be entitled to a 50% deposit bonus up to a maximum of €400. This essentially means that if you make a deposit of €400, you’ll have a total of €600 to play with. But that’s not all, the second deposit bonus also comes with a 100 spins to sweeten the deal. \n\n \n\nThird Deposit\n\nThe third and final part of the welcome package comes in the form of a 50% deposit bonus of up to €500 with another 100 spins to seal the deal. The gravy train doesn’t stop there though. Be sure to check out other promotions aimed at existing players, which can range from even more deposit bonuses and free spins. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nGame Selection at Bootlegger Casino\n\nAesthetics and a generous welcome bonus are irrelevant if the game selection is not sufficient. After all, players join casino sites to play casino games. There’s no way around it. The guys behind Bootlegger casino are well aware of this notion, which is why it comes loaded with over 850 games. Regardless of your game preference, we can guarantee that you’ll never experience a dull moment when playing at Bootlegger casino. \n\n \n\nOnline Slots\n\nIf you’re an online slot aficionado, Bootlegger casino is where you want to be, as 650 from the 850 games they have on offer are video slots. Bootlegger casino work with the best four game providers in the industry to ensure the gaming experience is second to none. Players have the option to filter games by game provider or use the search function to save time sifting through hundreds of games.
